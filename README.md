# Micron-Cartridge-Filter-Importance-Applications-and-Maintenance-in-Water-Treatment-Plants
From residential water filters to pre-filters on your industrial Reverse Osmosis system, cartridge filters are used in various applications. The main objective of a micron cartridge filter is to remove debris like small particles and sediments from your water supply. The feed water from springs, wells, and any other water source contains impurities of various kinds. A micron cartridge filter is designed to address this problem. <br>

What is a Cartridge Filter? <br>
A cartridge filter is a tube-like filtration instrument used across diverse industries for various filtration necessities. These filters are typically used to filter water from all elements and chemicals. <br>

It is developed to remove particles down to a size of 0.1 to 500 micrometers. The cartridge filter is enclosed in a housing or jacket. It removes contaminants from a fluid using a passage through a micro-porous membrane. Apart from this, a suitable cartridge filter has many advantages. <br>

Why Pre-Filtration and Good Micron Cartridge Filtration is Important <br>

1. Removes suspended solids to avoid membrane fouling <br>
Prefiltration by micron cartridge filter is an important part of optimizing the performance of an RO unit. Cartridge filters remove suspended particulates, colloids, and larger colors, causing particles and suspensions from the feed stream. This also helps improve the performance and longevity of the RO equipment and any high-performance units. <br>

2. Achieving a low silt density index (SDI) <br>
SDI, Color, and turbidity are the crucial factors that determine the efficiency of any RO or UF membrane. A good micron cartridge filter can help decrease the silt density index of the water, increasing the lifespan of the RO/ NF elements. Using a cartridge filter also allows the continuous high performance of the RO and NF membrane elements. <br>

3. Removal of bacteria to prevent biofouling of the membranes <br>
Bacterias ranges in size from 0.2 to 2 microns in width and 1 to 10 microns in length. Thus a 1-micron cartridge filter will remove most of the bacteria and cysts in the water and prevent the biofouling of the RO/ NF membrane. <br>

4. Lower operating expense  <br>
Proper pretreatment of the water will help prevent the fouling of the membranes. This results in lower operating costs for membrane cleaning, lower power consumption, and extended membrane life. <br>

Selecting The Best Micron Cartridge Filter for Industries in India <br>

Generally, micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India recommend using a cartridge filter with a smaller micron rating. However, there is a downside to this: as the micron rating gets smaller, especially when the water contains a lot of sediment, the flow capability of the water usually drops. <br>

The micron-size ratings can be ‘nominal’ or ‘absolute.’ <br>

Nominal Rating: A filter with a nominal rating has an arbitrary value assigned by the micron cartridge filter manufacturer.  The nominal rating refers to a filter that can cut off a nominated minimum percentage by the weight of solid particles of a specific contaminant greater than the assigned arbitrary value. <br>

Absolute Rating: The absolute rating of a micron cartridge filter refers to the diameter of the largest spherical particle. This is commonly expressed in ‘mm’ and represents the pore opening size of the medium filter. <br>

Applications of Micron Cartridge Filters for Industries in India <br>
•	Cold sterilization of beverages and pharmaceuticals <br>
•	Filtration of fruit juice, wines, and beers <br>
•	Separation of bacteria from water in biological wastewater treatment <br>
•	Effluent treatment <br>
•	Separation of water and oil emulsions <br>
•	Pre-treatment of water in nanofiltration or reverse osmosis systems <br>
•	Separation of solid-liquid in pharmaceutical or food industries <br>

Tips For Maintenance and Damage Prevention <br>

To ensure the longevity of your cartridge filter, micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India propose following the below tips: <br>
•	To avoid damage to the cartridge filter, ensure that the operational pressure does not exceed the allowed pressure range. High pressure can lead to the cartridge sheets being damaged or ripped. <br>
•	Avoid using hard metal brushes to clean the micron cartridge filter sheets during the membrane cleaning process. <br>
•	Avoid suddenly turning off the system; this can create a reverse jerk flow of water, swirls inside the filtration tank, and so on, resulting in abrupt damage to the system. <br>

Along with proper cleaning and maintenance, filters' quality also greatly impacts their life cycle and application. Using filters from the best <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/services/membrane-and-filters/kaicf.php">micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India</a> will ensure that you get an efficient and long-lasting micron cartridge filter fit for your industry. <br>
